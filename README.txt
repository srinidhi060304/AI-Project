README FILE


THERE ARE 4 FILES PRESENT IN THIS ZIP FOLDER

Details.xlsx : THIS FILE IS AN EXCEL DATABASE WHICH CONSISTS OF THE REGNO, NAMES, BRANCH, ETC OF THE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY, DATA OF ONLY THE 4 OF US IS RECORDED

start.py : THIS IS THE PYTHON FILE THAT U NEED TO RUN. THIS FILE INITIATES THE PROGRAM WHEN THE USER WANTS TO START.

verify.py : THIS PYTHON FILE IS THE MAIN FILE THAT CONTAINS THE MAIN CODE AND IS CALLED FROM THE start.py FILE. SO TO RUN THE PROGRAM U NEED TO EXECUTE THE start.py FILE IF U WANT TO START THE PROGRAM AFTER A USER INPUT ELSE RUN THIS FILE TO DIRECTLY START THE CODE.

check.py : THIS FILE IS TO CHECK WHAT ALL TEXT IS CAPTURED BY THE CAMERA IN CASE U WANT TO SEE FOR UR KNOWLEDGE


HOW TO RUN CODE AND HOW IT WORKS:

- RUN THE start.py FILE. THIS GIVES A PROMPT TO ENTER 's' OR 'start' WHICH AFTER ENTERING WILL START THE PROGRAM BY CALLING THE verify.py FILE. IT MAY TAKE A BIT OF TIME TO START AS IT NEEDS TO CREATE OBJECTS AND ALL AND IT WILL GIVE ANOTHER PROMPT TO PLACE UR ID CARD IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. 

- AFTER THIS PROMPT THE CAMERA SCREEN WILL POP UP ALONG WITH A COUNTDOWN OF 5 SECONDS IN THE TERMINAL(OR WHEREVER U SEE OUTPUT OF CODE). AFTER 5 SECONDS THE LAST FRAME WILL BE CAPTURED BY THE CAMERA AND STORED AS id.jpg IN WHICHEVER FOLDER U SAVED THE PROGRAMS. AFTER SAVING THE PROGRAM WILL CHECK THE IMAGE FOR TEXT AND THEN USING A PATTERN CHECKS FOR THE REGISTRATION NUMBER AND IF FOUND IT WILL PROCEED TO GET THE DETAILS FROM THE EXCEL SHEET AND PRINT THEM OUT. IF NOT FOUND YOU CAN TRY AGAIN(DEPENDS ON LIGHTING AND QUALITY) OR JUST RUN THE check.py FILE TO SEE WHAT TEXT IS CAPTURED.

-  AFTER FINDING THE REGISTRATION NUMBER THE PROGRAM WILL FORM THE LINK TO THE EMAIL USING SMTP PORT(YES,THE SAME SMTP FROM COMPUTER NETWORKS)THIS ALSO MAY TAKE A BIT OF TIME AS IT NEEDS TO CREATE OBJECT AND CONNECTION AND IT WILL LOGIN USING OUR 50shades gmail account.

- THEN A PROMPT WILL BE SHOWN STATING THAT AN OTP HAS BEEN SENT TO YOUR RESPECTIVE EMAIL AND TO ENTER THE OTP. YOU WILL HAVE 2 MINUTES TO ENTER THE OTP OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL SHOW A TIMEOUT MESSAGE AND EXIT. IF THE OTP IS ENTERED ON TIME, THEN IF YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE CORRECT OTP, THE PROGRAM WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND EXIT. IF THE WRONG OTP IS GIVEN IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE EXIT


THATS ALL FOR THIS PART OF THE PROJECT. IF ANY DOUBT ARISES OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ASK JUST MESSAGE. 

THANKS. PEACE✌️
